## Brief of the 5-year Average Benchmark
The ART/TREES-inspired benchmark computes the average of deforestation taking place in a 5-year window and uses that to predict the deforestation in 3 subsequent years in the future. 
It uses the [Mapbiomas](https://https://mapbiomas.org/en/download) dataset, and has been validated on 6x6 km validation grid.
