The following code contains the function to return the normalized continuous precision and recall values to validate the 5-year average benchmark and JNR.

The paths of the variables '_img_dir_' (actual deforestation) and '_avg_img_dir_' (predicted deforestation) can be modified as per the requirement.

**Brief of the 5-year Average Benchmark**
The ART/TREES-inspired benchmark computes the average of deforestation taking place in a 5-year window and uses that to predict the deforestation in 3 subsequent years in the future.

The derived values of precision and recall can be plotted as follows:

Here, the **Start Year** denotes the year_1 worth of predictions. For ex. Start Year : 2017 would mean that year_1 was 2017 for that case, year_2 was 2018 and year_3 was 2019.
